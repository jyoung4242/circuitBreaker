I need an image generated to fit a mobile game title screen called "Cricuit Breaker" where you are a field electrician whose racing against time to properly repair and rewire customer's electrical panels that are all messed up.
There should be some hero text in the Tile, and it should serve as a Loading Screen, the a Play button should pop up.  Being a PWA the button will unlock the audio context for the browser game, so its super important.  I'd also like for there to be an flag icon to represent internationalization options.
The game is mobile portrait and the canvas is 500 px wide versus 700 px high.
